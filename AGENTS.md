- Write tests with testify.
    - DON'T supply string descriptions in asserts (ex: assert.True(t, someBool, "dont include this string")) UNLESS the assert has indirection of some kind where extra context is needed.
- Misc Go coding guidelines:
    - RARELY sanitize strings with strings.TrimSpace. You may ONLY use strings.TrimSpace as part of a deliberate algorithm, not "just to be sure".
    - You probably don't need to use filepath.Clean: filepath's Join, Abs, Relative automatically Clean the result.
- Don't keep around old code/APIs to "support legacy codepaths" unless told otherwise, or unless you know for sure you need to.
