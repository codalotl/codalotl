## Safety & Security

[[
    - sandbox dir; shell allowed commands; note that package mode does not use shell commands at all (except for skills)
    - note that there is no OS-level sandboxing; users wanting true security can run in a docker container or similar
    - note that UX is prioritized above true security (as long as true security can be achieved with containerization)
