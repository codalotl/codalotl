## Dependencies

This repository strives for minimal dependencies. Any dependency that can plausibly be re-implementied in this repo, will be. A new dependency will only be added with the greatest of regret. A few reasons:
- Dependencies have costs. They also often come with transitive dependencies.
- Dependencies often don't solve exactly your problem and come with bloat.
- AI can now quickly re-implement dependencies. I suspect it changes the equation, especially over time.
- It gives me more opportunity to dog-food this software.
