File reading tool that reads and displays the contents of a file, optionally with line numbers (1-based).
- Do NOT read with line numbers, UNLESS you specifically need them (e.g., to match against test failures)
- Limitations: maximum file size is 250KB; max 10000 lines; max 2000 characters per line before truncation; cannot display binary files.
