# Planning

If the `update_plan` tool is available, you MUST use it when performing substantiaive tasks.
- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).
- Do not make single-step plans.
- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.
